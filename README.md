Note: this assignment is not yet complete, and more will be added.

# This is an assignment for BootCamp Spot coding bootcamp Week 05.

# It is a workday scheduler that can store and retrieve text via hour block over the course of a typical 9-hour work day (9 AM - 5 PM).

# The date, time, and day of the week are displayed in real time with the help of the jsdays Javascript library.

# It also color codes and updates in real time whether an hour block is in the past, present, or future.

A link to the live site will be added here once it is deployed.
