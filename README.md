# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple workday scheduler that can store and retrieve text by hour block, which are color coded in real time for past, present, and future.
In theory, can be used on weekends too if you're a schedule-aholic.

* This is an assignment for BootCamp Spot coding bootcamp Week 05.

* It is a workday scheduler that can store and retrieve text in individual hour blocks over the course of a typical 9-hour work day (9 AM - 6 PM).

* The date, time, and day of the week are displayed in real time with the help of the jsdays Javascript library.

* It also color codes and updates in real time whether an hour block is in the past, present, or future.

I believe that currently this assignment meets the criteria requested. I do think I can make the code prettier and may add to it, but at the moment I believe it is complete.
